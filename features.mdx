## Governance and Policy Modules

Manage policies with CUSNIR OS governance modules. You define rules, assign roles, and track compliance in real time.

<ParamField path="policy.id" param-type="string" required="true">
  Unique policy identifier.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="rules" param-type="array" required="false">
  Array of rule objects defining enforcement logic.
</ParamField>

## Cognitive Processing Elements

CUSNIR OS cognitive elements process data through neural-like networks. You configure weights for factors like ethics, efficiency, and impact.

    C --> D[Output Decision]
    D --> E[Feedback Loop]

<CodeGroup tabs="JSON,TypeScript">
````json
{
  "weights": {
    "ethics": 0.4,
    "efficiency": 0.3,
    "impact": 0.3
  },
  "threshold": 0.7
}
````
````typescript
interface CognitiveConfig {
  weights: { ethics: number; efficiency: number; impact: number };
  threshold: number;
}

const config: CognitiveConfig = {
  weights: { ethics: 0.4, efficiency: 0.3, impact: 0.3 },
  threshold: 0.7
};
````
